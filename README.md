Reads words into a program from a text file. The user is prompted to enter a word and the program will show how many times that word appears in the file. Furthermore, if the user enters a '?' in place of a character the program will treat the question mark as a wildcard that can be any letter, as well as no letter at all. If multiple words are viable then the program will print out every potential word that fits the definition.
